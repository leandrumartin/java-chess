# Java Chess

This game of chess was created as the final project, with two collaborators, for the class CSCI 2300: Principles of Object-Oriented Software Design at Saint Louis University. The goal was to implement an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and implement whatever object-oriented software patterns were most appropriate for readability and scalability.

## Features

* Two players
* Set time limit
